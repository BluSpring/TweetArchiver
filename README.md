# Twitter Tweet Archiver

A quick tweet archiver for if you want to archive your friend's tweets. Still works as of 13/5/2023.
I don't know if it works with Elon's new API, but it works with the old v2 at least.

I wrote this code on the 25th of April 2022 to archive another person's tweets, and surprisingly, it worked well and archived a lot of their tweets. I don't know how far back the Twitter API allows me to go.

I came back to it on the 13th of May 2023 to archive a passed friend's Twitter accounts, and was surprised to find that the code still functioned perfectly. I modified it to also include media and the tweets that was replied to, which turned out to be slightly weird to do. I'll have it also download all the images and videos too, before it's too late.
